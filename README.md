# Organics-Dataset-Data-Mining
* Created a sample set on SAS Enterprise Miner by identifying the target variables.
* Data partitioned into 3 sets - Training (40%), Validation (30%) and Testing(30%).
*	Transformed it using the filter and transform node to make a useful data set.
*	Created multiple regression, neural network and decision tree models to refine the data set and understand it to make the business reach a larger customer base.
*	Analysis was based on understanding the cumulative, lift charts and confusion matrix.

## Models

* Regression - Full, Forward, Backward, Stepwise, Imputed, Filtered and Transformed.
* Neural Networks - Default, Filtered, Transformed, Imputed and 5 hidden nodes.
* Decision Tree - Default, 3-way, Pruned and Manual.
